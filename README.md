# Dynamic Frontend Design Patterns

## Work In Progress

**I've been developing in the full stack for some time and have noticed some areas where there is a lot of repetition. I hope to come up with simple design patterns that would prevent these repetitons and help developers follow the DRY principle.**

_This doc contains examples which assume we're using Angular and Chart.js (ng2-charts) but as with all design patterns, this is not limited to a specific framework._

The examples provided are of applications that I've actually worked on. So feel free to point out issues and suggest fixes.
